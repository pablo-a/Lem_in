# Lem_in
This **algorithmic** project is about finding the most efficient way to allow ants to reach the end of a labyrinth.
In order to do this, the user must enter a map :

## Map entry

*define rooms like : `name coordx coordy`.
*define connections like : `name1 name2`.
*use `##START` and `##END` before the line defining the starting or ending room.
