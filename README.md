This *algorithmic* project is about finding the most efficient way to allow ants to reach the end of a labyrinth.
In order to do this, the user must enter a map :

*defining rooms like : `name coordx coordy`
*defining connections like : `name1 name2`
*using `##START` and `##END` before the line defining the starting or ending room
